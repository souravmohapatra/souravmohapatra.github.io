Hi, I'm **Sourav Mohapatra**, a Senior Software Engineer at **ARM, Cambridge (UK)**, working on the Total Compute platform across various software stacks such as TrustedFirmware, U-Boot, Linux kernel, and RSE/SCP. 

I have a passion for embedded systems, low-level optimizations, and building reliable software for complex hardware platforms. Previously, I contributed to mission-critical projects at **ASML** in the Netherlands and **Qualcomm** in India, focusing on embedded drivers, sensor integrations, and Wi-Fi technologies.

I hold an **MSc in Embedded Systems** from **TU Delft** (graduated with distinction, top 5%), and a **BTech in Computer Science and Engineering** from **NIT Rourkela**.

My research focuses on cache architectures for intermittent computing systems, and I have publications in top-tier venues like **ASPLOS** and **ACM**.

In my free time, I enjoy photography, tinkering with hardware projects, and continuously learning about emerging computing architectures.
