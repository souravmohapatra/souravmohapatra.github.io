This paper proposes a schedulability test algorithm for Real-Time Monotonic Algorithm (RMA), which reduces the number of iterations needed to assess system feasibility. 

The algorithm addresses high complexities in large task sets and extends to multiprocessor environments, comparing performance across varying processor counts. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing algorithms in efficiency and computational load.
