This research presents NACHO: a data cache tailored for intermittently-powered embedded computing platforms utilizing non-volatile memory. 

NACHO minimizes checkpoint overhead and increases system performance by integrating write-after-read (WAR) detection directly into the cache. Results show a 54% reduction in runtime overhead and an 82% reduction in non-volatile memory writes compared to cache-less systems.
